# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About
This repository contains all practical exercises for **CP1404 Programming II**. I am a EE student from Western Australia where I still work today.



## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- **Meaningful names improve readability** — use verbs for functions, nouns for variables
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** — one function, one job
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** — reuse code with functions and patterns
- **Good commit messages** — imperative mood, capitalised, no full-stop
