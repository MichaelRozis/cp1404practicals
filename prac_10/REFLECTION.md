# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Was ok, but I would often space out my time with long breaks doing other tasks and coming in and out

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It seems relativly similar as some of the later tasks took me a longer but the short tasks I was able to get through faster.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Before doing a task I should check my previous work for correlating code prior to my estimation.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I need to improve docstrings.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

How I should be writing docstrings.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

**NOTE** 

I only recieved 2 code reviews

### Good Code Review 1

- [@elijahwalkerrr prac 5](https://github.com/elijahwalkerrr/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

This code was a well written example for prac 5, I found a breach of SRP and reminded programmer of DRY. Framed my comments as a question so they can begin thinking about how they made a mistake without just saying tis incorrect. Was good, well written code.

### Good Code Review 2

- [@Lachlan-Torrisi prac 7](https://github.com/Lachlan-Torrisi/cp1404practical/pull/2)

### Explanation

This was for Prac 7, I was able to identify a few elements of the code not taught in the subject and offered alternative. Code worked well and mostly followed style guide.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Potentially decreasing number of tasks and making one or 2 larger tasks with more complexity. But in saying that I like the subjects structure as is.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did well with version control specifically commit messages towards the end of the subject and I also did well with naming and sticking to DRY and SRP.
