I will keep getting my prac in every week, using meaningful names and following the program patterns.

I should be doing more of the tasks within the weekly video lectures.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Subject is pretty good, and in regards to IT overall I am a EE student, but I can definetly see how this class set IT students up for success especcially with the heavy focus on communication and github.
